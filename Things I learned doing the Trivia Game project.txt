Things I learned doing the Trivia Game project AND questions about things I would like to try but don't know how:

Things Learned:
==========================================
1. How to create comments in:
	CSS:		/* comment */
	HTML:		<!-- comment -->
	Javascript:	// comment
	
2. The concept of nessting a div inside another div. In this case inside index.html, I see three nested divs:
   <div id="wrapper">
      <h1>Bestest Trivia Game Ever!</h1>
      <div id="sub-wrapper">
        <div id="quiz-area"> 

   Still not clear on why this is a helpful method.



Questions that arose during the process:
==========================================
1. How to make the background image (stretch?) fill the entire screen regardless of screen resolution?
2. I couldn't find in the code where the font settings for the Start button's text were located. 
   Kyle showed me how to find them using the Chrome Dev Tools, but I don't understand why I can't see them in the code.
3. timer = setInterval(game.countdown, 1000) 
   "timer" is a variable local to the "start" function, and it is set using the setInterval method and its properties 
   to create a value of 120 seconds to use as the amount of time a player gets to complete the quiz.
   Am I saying this correctly? Method and properties?
4. The "done" function is repetetive. Is there a way to put the questions into an array, and use a for loop to run the        
   functions $.each($("input[name='question-0']:checked"), function() {
             if ($(this).val() === questions[0].correctAnswer) {
             game.correct++;
             }
             else {
             game.incorrect++;
             }
             });
   and use the array index instead of having to run one function per question?
